That is why people can pray it before anything improves. It also helps to say it in a room with others. At our Thursday prayer meeting we hear each other say it, and that carries you for a week."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can God really make me feel like myself again?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, though it is usually gradual. People who pray through a hard season often describe strength coming back in small amounts rather than all at once. Keep asking. Keep showing up."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Where do I find courage when I am scared?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "You ask for it, and you ask again the next day. Courage in the Bible looks less like fearlessness and more like taking the next step while still afraid. Praying for it before a hard conversation or a hospital visit gives you something to hold."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I accept something I cannot change?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Start by saying it plainly to God instead of arguing with it in your head. Trusting that He is in charge of the outcome takes the weight of control off you. Peace tends to arrive after you have let go, not while you are still holding on tight."}}]}]

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-extrabold text-[#1a1a1a]">Why pray this?</h2>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#1a1a1a] leading-snug">{"Does God get tired of me?"}</h3>
              <p className="text-[#595959] leading-relaxed mt-2">{"No. He does not get worn out by people, and He does not get worn out by you. That is worth praying about out loud, because most of us carry a quiet fear that we have used up our welcome. Saying the opposite in prayer starts to loosen that fear."}</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#1a1a1a] leading-snug">{"Why does God let things happen that make no sense to me?"}</h3>
              <p className="text-[#595959] leading-relaxed mt-2">{"Honest answer: we often do not find out why, at least not soon. What Christians hold on to is that God understands the whole situation while we see one corner of it. Praying that does not explain your pain. It does give you somewhere to put it."}</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#1a1a1a] leading-snug">{"What do I pray when I am too exhausted to pray?"}</h3>
              <p className="text-[#595959] leading-relaxed mt-2">{"Say one line. \"God, I am tired, help me\" is a real prayer. God gives strength to people who admit they have none, so being honest about the exhaustion is the starting point rather than a failure."}</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#1a1a1a] leading-snug">{"How do I have hope when nothing is changing?"}</h3>
              <p className="text-[#595959] leading-relaxed mt-2">{"Hope leans on God's character while your circumstances stay exactly the same. That is why people can pray it before anything improves. It also helps to say it in a room with others. At our Thursday prayer meeting we hear each other say it, and that carries you for a week."}</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#1a1a1a] leading-snug">{"Can God really make me feel like myself again?"}</h3>
              <p className="text-[#595959] leading-relaxed mt-2">{"Yes, though it is usually gradual. People who pray through a hard season often describe strength coming back in small amounts rather than all at once. Keep asking. Keep showing up."}</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#1a1a1a] leading-snug">{"Where do I find courage when I am scared?"}</h3>
              <p className="text-[#595959] leading-relaxed mt-2">{"You ask for it, and you ask again the next day. Courage in the Bible looks less like fearlessness and more like taking the next step while still afraid. Praying for it before a hard conversation or a hospital visit gives you something to hold."}</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#1a1a1a] leading-snug">{"How do I accept something I cannot change?"}</h3>
              <p className="text-[#595959] leading-relaxed mt-2">{"Start by saying it plainly to God instead of arguing with it in your head. Trusting that He is in charge of the outcome takes the weight of control off you. Peace tends to arrive after you have let go, not while you are still holding on tight."}</p>
