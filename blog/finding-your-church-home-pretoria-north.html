    <h1>Finding Your Church Home in Pretoria North</h1>
    <p>Searching for a simple, loving place to worship in Pretoria North? Fountain of Grace is a small church that meets in a home — where family, faith, and grace come first.</p>
  </section>

  <main>
    <h2>Where Your Search Truly Begins</h2>
    <p>Finding a church family isn’t about joining a crowd — it’s about finding a place where your heart feels at peace. At Fountain of Grace, we don’t have big buildings or fancy stages. We are three families who gather in a home, share meals, pray together, and let God do the growing.</p>

    <p>If you’ve been looking for something real — not perfect — we might just be the church for you. Here, we believe every story matters and that no one is too broken for restoration.</p>

    <h2>Our Worship Style</h2>
    <p>Our worship is simple — we sing, we pray, and we share the Word of God. Sometimes it’s quiet, sometimes it’s joyful, but always led by the Holy Spirit. You’ll find no performance here, only presence.</p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We are a small, non-denominational Christian church in Pretoria North that believes in restoration through grace. We don’t have a rented hall or sound system — we gather as family in homes. What we do have is love, prayer, and faith in God’s provision for what’s next.</p>

    <h2>Visiting for the First Time?</h2>
    <p>Come as you are. Bring your children, bring your questions, bring your heart. There’s no dress code, no pressure — just people who love Jesus and each other.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Fountain of Grace Different</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We’re real people — not performers.</li>
      <li>We believe in prayer, not perfection.</li>
      <li>We don’t have a church building — but we have a strong foundation: Christ.</li>
      <li>We’re small enough to know you by name, and big enough to love you like family.</li>
    </ul>

    <section class="cta">
      <h3>Plan Your Visit</h3>
      <p>We’d love to meet you and worship together. Join us for Sunday service at 09:00 at 323B Danie Theron Street, Pretoria North.</p>
