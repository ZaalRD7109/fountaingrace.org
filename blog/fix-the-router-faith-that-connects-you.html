    <h2>Theme: When God Feels Far, Check Your Faith Connection</h2>
    <p>Family, God hasn’t moved. His presence is like a strong signal that never drops. But like a home Wi-Fi, you can have the router, the subscription, even the password—and still be disconnected if something is wrong on your side. Faith is that “router” in the spirit. When it’s healthy, heaven’s supply flows.</p>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      “And without faith it is impossible to please God…” <small>Hebrews 11:6 (NIV)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Scripture Foundation: Trust Over Trying</h2>
    <p>We often treat life like it’s all on our effort. But the gospel isn’t about earning; it’s about trusting. Like a child who simply expects bread from a loving parent, we lean on the Father.</p>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      “Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?” <small>Matthew 7:9 (NIV)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.” <small>Proverbs 3:5 (NIV)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Revelation: Faith Is Your Router</h2>
    <p>Here’s the picture: God’s promise is broadcast everywhere. The <em>issue</em> is our receiver. When doubt, offense, fear, or old mindsets clog the firmware, the connection stutters. The fix isn’t more striving—it’s renewal.</p>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind…” <small>Romans 12:2 (ESV)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>How to “Update the Firmware” of Your Faith</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear the cache:</strong> forgive quickly. Unforgiveness blocks the signal (see <em>Mark 11:25</em>).</li>
      <li><strong>Re-enter the password:</strong> speak what God says. His promises are <em>Yes</em> and <em>Amen</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay within range:</strong> gather with the church; encouragement boosts reception.</li>
      <li><strong>Power-cycle your heart:</strong> fasting and prayer don’t twist God’s arm; they empty us so He can fill us.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      “For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory.” <small>2 Corinthians 1:20 (ESV)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Emotional Arc: From Frustrated to Reconnected</h2>
    <p>Many of us start here: “Lord, I know You’re there, but I feel nothing.” Then the Spirit nudges, “It’s not the signal. Fix the router.” As we release control, forgive, and renew our minds, hope rises. The peace of God returns. We step out again, and promises come alive.</p>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      “Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” <small>Luke 12:32 (ESV)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Practical Steps: Five Ways to Restore Strong Signal</h2>
    <h3>1) Admit the drop</h3>
    <p>Honesty invites healing. Tell God where it hurts and where you’ve doubted.</p>

    <h3>2) Forgive and let go</h3>
    <p>Old disappointments create interference. Release them by name to Jesus (see <em>Mark 11:25</em>).</p>

    <h3>3) Declare the Word daily</h3>
    <p>Faith comes by hearing. Read the Word aloud. Put promises on your walls, your mirror, your phone.</p>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      “But let him ask in faith, with no doubting…” <small>James 1:6 (ESV)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>4) Stay plugged into the Body</h3>
    <p>Isolation weakens the connection. Sundays matter. Mid-week matters. Testimonies stir faith.</p>

    <h3>5) Remember the Source owns it all</h3>
    <p>Provision isn’t scarce in God’s kingdom. The silver and the gold are His. Expect His glory to increase.</p>

    <blockquote class="verse">
      “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the LORD… The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former.” <small>Haggai 2:8–9 (ESV)</small>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>One-Liners to Carry Into Your Week</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>God’s broadcast is constant; my faith is the router.</li>
      <li>Less striving, more trusting.</li>
      <li>Renewed mind, restored signal.</li>
      <li>Yes and Amen is my password.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Short Prayer</h2>
    <p><em>Father, fix my faith connection. I turn from doubt and renew my mind with Your Word. I forgive, I release, and I receive. Reconnect me to Your peace and power, in Jesus’ name. Amen.</em></p>
