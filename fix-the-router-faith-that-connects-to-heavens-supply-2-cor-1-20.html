      <h1>Fix the Router: Faith That Connects to Heaven’s Supply</h1>
      <p class="muted">Faith is the “router” that aligns us to God’s always-on signal. When we renew our minds, forgive freely, and trust like children, the promises of God switch on in our everyday life (2 Cor 1:20).</p>
    </section>

    <div class="wrap">
      <article class="post">
        <p><em>Family, God’s presence is not the problem—our connection is. Like a router that’s powered but misconfigured, our faith sometimes needs a reset so we can receive what Heaven is already broadcasting.</em></p>

        <h2>Faith Is Your Router to God’s Supply</h2>
        <blockquote class="verse">“And without faith it is impossible to please God.” — <strong>Hebrews 11:6, NIV</strong></blockquote>
        <p>God is constant. His love and supply do not cut out. Yet we often rely on effort and performance—as if hustle could buy signal strength. It’s not our works that unlock breakthrough. Think of the CEO who closes a deal on the golf course. It’s not hours worked; it’s access. Faith is access. Faith believes that God is present and good even when feelings buffer.</p>
        <blockquote class="verse">“For no matter how many promises God has made, they are ‘Yes’ in Christ. And so through him the ‘Amen’ is spoken by us to the glory of God.” — <strong>2 Corinthians 1:20, NIV</strong></blockquote>
        <p>Heaven’s network is live; Christ is the Yes. Our Amen is the agreement that releases it into our now.</p>

        <h2>Update the Firmware: Renew Your Mind</h2>
        <blockquote class="verse">“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.” — <strong>Romans 12:2, ESV</strong></blockquote>
        <p>Sometimes the “router” isn’t broken; it just needs a firmware update. Life loads us with fear, disappointments, and unhelpful stories. Clear the cache. Let God rewrite your defaults. How? Stay near His Word and His people. Testimonies stir faith; worship recentres the heart; community keeps you within range.</p>
        <blockquote class="verse">“Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.” — <strong>Proverbs 3:5, NIV</strong></blockquote>
        <p>Childlike trust is powerful. Kids don’t check the pantry ledger before asking for lunch. Jesus said even earthly parents give bread, not stones <em>(see Matthew 7:9–11)</em>. Your Father delights to provide. Step away from overthinking and step into trusting.</p>

        <h2>Remove Firewalls: Forgive, Ask, and Switch On</h2>
        <blockquote class="verse">“And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone.” — <strong>Mark 11:25, ESV</strong></blockquote>
        <p>Unforgiveness is a firewall that blocks flow. Release it. Then ask boldly.</p>
        <blockquote class="verse">“According to your faith be it done to you.” — <strong>Matthew 9:29, ESV</strong></blockquote>
        <p>Jesus meets us at the level of our expectation. Abraham’s circumstances shouted “impossible,” yet he “did not waver through unbelief… but was strengthened in his faith” <em>(Romans 4:20)</em>. Your situation may look offline, but the Kingdom is “always broadcasting.”</p>
        <blockquote class="verse">“Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” — <strong>Luke 12:32, ESV</strong></blockquote>
        <p>Heaven is generous. Swipe the “card” of faith—not presumption, but confidence in the Father’s account.</p>

        <h2>Practical Ways to Fix Your Faith Connection</h2>
        <p><strong>1) Power-cycle your heart:</strong> step back from the swirl, breathe, worship, and remember God’s faithfulness.</p>
        <p><strong>2) Update your mind’s firmware:</strong> daily Scripture intake; speak God’s promises out loud; replace old stories with truth.</p>
        <p><strong>3) Remove blockages:</strong> forgive quickly; repent of self-reliance; ask the Holy Spirit to highlight any “firewalls.”</p>
        <p><strong>4) Stay within range:</strong> gather with the church; testimonies boost signal; isolation weakens it.</p>
        <p><strong>5) Pray like this:</strong></p>
        <blockquote class="verse">“But let him ask in faith, with no doubting…” — <strong>James 1:6, ESV</strong></blockquote>
        <p><em>Father, fix my faith connection. I trust You like a child again. Your promises are Yes in Jesus; my heart says Amen today.</em></p>
